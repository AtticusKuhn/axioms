# Axioms

I am interested in using the thereom prover Lean
to prove some propositions about the rings
from only their axioms.


# Axioms I am using

* (commutative addition) a+b=b+a
* (commutative multiplication) a*b=b*a
* (associative addtion) a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c
* (associative multiplication) a*(b*c)= (a*b)*c
* (zero) a+0=a
* negatives a+(-a) = 0
* one a*1 = a
