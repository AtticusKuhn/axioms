# Axioms

I am interested in using the thereom prover Lean
to prove some propositions about the rings
from only their axioms.


# Axioms I am using

* (commutative addition) a+b=b+a
* (commutative multiplication) ab=ba
* (associative addtion) a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c
* (associative multiplication) a(bc)= (ab)c
* (zero) a+0=a
* (negatives) a+(-a) = 0
* (one) a(1) = a

# My Progress
To see my progress, go to src/axioms.lean.
I have proven several interesting propositions so far, such as 

* a(0) = 0
* (-1)a = -a
